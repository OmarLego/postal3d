HOW TO RUN THE DAMN THING:

1. Download the zip from github (if youre working on the project, perferably you would clone the folder with github desktop so all the latest changes apply instantly but shh)
2. Extract the pk3 files inside the main zip/folder
3. Run both the zip/folder and the proper patch .pk3 file, just like you would the one from doomworld
