POSTAL: Red Letter Day is a reimanging of the original POSTAL game that makes you see and know the world from the gunman's eyes.
You get to see everything up close and personal and answer the question: What Went Wrong?


HOW TO RUN THE GAME IN DEVELOPMENT:

1. Download the zip from github ((If you're working on the project, perferably you would clone the folder with GitHub Desktop ( https://desktop.github.com/download/ )) so all the latest changes apply instantly)

2. Drag the zip/folder to GZDoom Engine .exe

CAN'T USE THE LATEST GZDOOM?:

No problem, look in the "MAPINFO.txt" and "zscript.zs" files for further instructions (methods only tested with GZDoom 4.7.1 and LZDoom 3.88b)
